This project was done as part of a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates with MIT Haystack Observatory over the summer of 2020, and was presented at the January 2021 meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).
I was mentored by Dr. Kazunori Akiyama, and utilized data taken in multiple frequency regimes to analyze the quasar 3C279's jet evolution as it progressed away from the central engine. The jet width evolution is determined by the relative density of space; using multiple frequency regimes allowed us to analyze changes in jet width at progressively further distances from the core.
