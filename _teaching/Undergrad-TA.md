While pursuing my undergraduate degrees, I was employed as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant by the URI Physics Department. I commenced TAing in the Spring of sophomore year, until my graduation in the spring of 2021. In this position, TAs were responsible for administration of weekly recitation sections for various calculus-based Physics classes. These were one-hour mandatory sessions where students were required to break into small groups and solve problems set by the course instructor covering the past week of lectures. 

Teaching assistants circulated the room and assisted students navigate to the correct answers by asking guiding questions and offering hints as to where students' methods were inaccurate. As such, familiarity with covered material is a requisite part of the position. Undergraduate TA positions were available for the three main calculus-based Physics classes:

- Elementary Physics I (PHY203): Newtonian Kinematics
- Elementary Physics II (PHY204): Electicity and Magnetism
- Elementary Physics III (PHY205): Thermodynamics, Optics, and Acoustics

Following the completion of each recitation section, each student's answers are graded and input into an online form by the end of the week.
