In the spring semester of my Masters degree, I was an Instructor of Record for an introductory calculus course focused on applications in the life sciences.
As an Instructor of Record, I was responsible for:

- Developing twice-weekly, hour and a half lectures 
- Coordinating with other instructors to ensure each section of students is covering required material
- Scheduling and grading exams
- Timely grading of homework, with relevant feedback
- Handling student issues and scheduling requirements

Material covered in this class was aimed at providing a comprehensive, gradual introduction to calculus. Lessons began by covering relevant algebraic concepts (graphing, grouping, solving systems of equations), progressing into concepts aimed at introducing calculus (Riemann sums, limits, maxima/minima problems.) and then dove into calculus concepts (derivatives of algebraic/logarithmic/exponential/trigonometric functions, interpretation of relevant word problems) and ended with basic integration. A focus was lent to the use of word problems with a focus on life sciences concepts (e.g. time evolution of absorbed dose, population growth).
